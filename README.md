# Yatzy game
[Design System](docs/design_system.md)
## Rules
You have up to 3 rolls per turn. In each turn you can choose which dice you keep (the rest are rerolled).
During each turn you must choose a method to [score](#Scoring) as described below. Each scoring method must be used only once per game.
### Scoring
#### Upper Section
- Ones: The sum of all dice showing the number 1.
- Twos: The sum of all dice showing the number 2.
- Threes: The sum of all dice showing the number 3.
- Fours: The sum of all dice showing the number 4.
- Fives: The sum of all dice showing the number 5.
- Sixes: The sum of all dice showing the number 6.

A bonus of 50 points is awarded if the sum of the upper section is 63 or larger. 

#### Lower Section
- One Pair: Two dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those two dice.
- Two Pairs: Two different pairs of dice. Score: Sum of dice in those two pairs.
- Three of a Kind: Three dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those three dice.
- Four of a Kind: Four dice with the same number. Score: Sum of those four dice.
- Small Straight: The combination 1-2-3-4-5. Score: 15 points (sum of all the dice).
- Large Straight: The combination 2-3-4-5-6. Score: 20 points (sum of all the dice).
- Full House: Any set of three combined with a different pair. Score: Sum of all the dice.
- Chance: Any combination of dice. Score: Sum of all the dice.
- Yatzy: All five dice with the same number. Score: 50 points.

*Note Two Pairs and Full House must have different numbers in the subsets used for the pairs. For example the combination 1-5-5-6-6 will score 22 as Two Pairs, but 1-5-5-5-5 will score nothing in that category because the two pairs must be different.
